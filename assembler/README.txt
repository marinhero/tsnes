USAGE

asm6 is a straightforward, fast assembler designed to convert 6502 assembly code into machine code suitable for systems like the NES. Here's how you can use asm6 to assemble your code:
Basic Command

bash

asm6 [options] sourcefile [outputfile] [listfile]

    sourcefile: The path to your assembly source code file (e.g., sum.asm).
    outputfile (optional): The name of the binary file to generate (e.g., output.nes).
    listfile (optional): A text file containing a detailed listing of the assembled code.

Options

    -?: Display help information.
    -l: Create a listing file showing the assembly instructions and the generated machine code.
    -L: Create a verbose listing file that expands macros and repeats (useful for debugging).
    -d<name>: Define a symbol for use in conditional assembly.
    -q: Quiet mode â€“ suppresses output unless there is an error.

Examples
1. Basic Assembly

Assemble the source file sum.asm and generate an output file named output.nes:

bash

asm6 sum.asm output.nes

2. Create a Listing File

To generate an additional listing file (sum.lst) that contains the assembled instructions and addresses:

bash

asm6 -l sum.asm output.nes

This creates two files:

    output.nes: The assembled binary suitable for NES emulators.
    sum.lst: A listing file showing the addresses, opcodes, and assembly instructions.

3. Quiet Mode

To assemble the file quietly without outputting messages, use the -q option:

bash

asm6 -q sum.asm output.nes

Code Example for NES Development

Here's a minimal NES program to use with asm6:

asm

.org $8000         ; Start of NES program in PRG-ROM

RESET:
    SEI            ; Disable interrupts
    CLD            ; Clear decimal mode
    LDX #$FF       ; Load X register with $FF
    TXS            ; Transfer X to the stack pointer

    LDA #$01       ; Load A with 1
    STA $0200      ; Store A in memory address $0200

    JMP RESET      ; Infinite loop

    .org $FFFC     ; Set the reset vector
    .dw RESET

To assemble this code, run:

bash

asm6 mygame.asm mygame.nes

Notes

    Ensure your NES programs use .org $8000 to start, as this is the expected starting address for the PRG-ROM.
    Use .org $FFFC and .dw RESET to set the reset vector correctly.

asm6 is designed to be simple yet powerful, making it an ideal choice for beginners and experienced NES developers alike.

ASM6 (v1.6)
A 6502 assembler by loopy (loopy at mm.st)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it's another 6502 assembler.  I built it to do NES development, but you
can probably use it for just about anything.  Why use this instead of one of
the other zillion assemblers out there?  I don't know, but choice is good,
right? :)  I wrote it because I thought most others were either too finicky,
had weird syntax, took too much work to set up, or too bug-ridden to be useful.

This is free software.  You may use, modify, and / or redistribute any part
of this software in any fashion.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Command line
--------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

        asm6 [-options] sourcefile [outputfile] [listfile]

Options:

        -?         Show some help
        -l         Create listing
        -L         Create verbose listing (expand REPT, MACRO)
        -d<name>:  Define a symbol and make it equal to 1
	-q         Quiet mode (suppress all output unless there's an error)
        Default output is <sourcefile>.bin
        Default listing is <sourcefile>.lst

--------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax
--------------------------------------------------------------

Comments begin with a semicolon (;).  A colon (:) following a label is
optional.

    examples:

        lda #$00             ;hi there
        label1: jmp label2
        label2  beq label1

--------------------------------------------------------------
Numbers and expressions
--------------------------------------------------------------

Hexadecimal numbers begin with '$' or end with 'h'.  Binary numbers begin
with '%' or end with 'b'.  Characters and strings are surrounded by
single or double quotes.  The characters (' " \) within quotes must be
preceded by a backslash (\).

    examples:

        12345
        '12345'
        $ABCD
        0ABCDh
        %01010101
        01010101b

Supported operators (listed by precedence):

          ( )
 (unary)  + - ~ ! < >
          * / %
          + -
          << >>
          < > <= >=
          = == != <> 
          &
          ^
          |
          &&
          ||

'=' and '<>' are equivalent to C's '==' and '!=' operators.  The unary '<'
and '>' operators give the lower and upper byte of a 16-bit word (respectively).
All other operators function like their C equivalents.
        
--------------------------------------------------------------
Labels
--------------------------------------------------------------

Labels are case sensitive.  The special '$' label holds the current program
address.  Labels beginning with '@' are local labels. They have limited scope,
visible only between non-local labels.  Names of local labels may be reused.

        label1:
          @tmp1:
          @tmp2:
        label2:
          @tmp1:
          @tmp2:

Labels beginning with one or more '+' or '-' characters are nameless labels,
especially useful for forward and reverse branches.

    example:

      --  ldx #0
       -  lda $2002 ;loop (wait for vblank)
          bne -
       -  lda $2002 ;nameless labels are easy to reuse..
          bne -

          cpx #69
          beq +     ;forward branch..
          cpx #96
          beq +here ;use more characters to make more unique

          jmp --    ;multiple --'s handy for nested loops
       +  ldx #0
   +here  nop
        
--------------------------------------------------------------
Assembler directives (in no particular order)
--------------------------------------------------------------

All directives are case insensitive and can also be preceded by a period (.)


EQU

        For literal string replacement, similar to #define in C.

                one EQU 1
                plus EQU +
                DB one plus one ;DB 1 + 1

=

        Unlike EQU, statements with '=' are evaluated to a number first.
        Also unlike EQU, symbols created with '=' can be reused.

                i=1
                j EQU i+1
                k=i+1   ;k=1+1
                i=j+1   ;i=i+1+1
                i=k+1   ;i=2+1

INCLUDE (also INCSRC)

        Assemble another source file as if it were part of the current
        source.

                INCLUDE whatever.asm

INCBIN (also BIN)

        Add the contents of a file to the assembly output.

                moredata: INCBIN whatever.bin

	An optional file offset and size can be specified.

		INCBIN foo.bin, $400		;read foo.bin from $400 to EOF
		INCBIN foo.bin, $200, $2000	;read $2000 bytes, starting from $200

DB, DW (also BYTE/WORD, DCB/DCW, DC.B/DC.W)

        Emit byte(s) or word(s).  Multiple arguments are separated by
        commas.  Strings can be "shifted" by adding a value to them (see
        example).

                DB $01,$02,$04,$08
                DB "ABCDE"+1          ;equivalent to DB "BCDEF"
                DB "ABCDE"-"A"+32     ;equivalent to DB 32,33,34,35,36

DL, DH

        Similar to DB, outputting only the LSB or MSB of a value.

                DL a,b,c,d            ;equivalent to DB <a, <b, <c, <d
                DH a,b,c,d            ;equivalent to DB >a, >b, >c, >d

HEX

        Compact way of laying out a table of hex values.  Only raw hex values
        are allowed, no expressions.  Spaces can be used to separate numbers.

                HEX 456789ABCDEF  ;equivalent to DB $45,$67,$89,$AB,$CD,$EF
                HEX 0 1 23 4567   ;equivalent to DB $00,$01,$23,$45,$67

DSB, DSW (also DS.B/DS.W)

        Define storage (bytes or words).  The size argument may be followed
        by a fill value (default filler is 0).

                DSB 4         ;equivalent to DB 0,0,0,0
                DSB 8,1       ;equivalent to DB 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
                DSW 4,$ABCD   ;equivalent to DW $ABCD,$ABCD,$ABCD,$ABCD

PAD

        Fill memory from the current address to a specified address.  A fill
        value may also be specified.

                PAD $FFFA     ;equivalent to DSB $FFFA-$
                PAD $FFFA,$EA ;equivalent to DSB $FFFA-$,$EA

ORG

        Set the starting address if it hasn't been assigned yet, otherwise
        ORG functions like PAD.

                ORG $E000     ;start assembling at $E000
                .
                .
                .
                ORG $FFFA,$80 ;equivalent to PAD $FFFA,$80

ALIGN

        Fill memory from the current address to an N byte boundary.  A fill
        value may also be specified.

                ALIGN 256,$EA

FILLVALUE

        Change the default filler for PAD, ALIGN, etc.

                FILLVALUE $FF

BASE

        Set the program address.  This is useful for relocatable code,
        multiple code banks, etc.  The same can also be accomplished by
        assigning the '$' symbol directly (i.e. '$=9999').

                oldaddr=$
                BASE $6000
                stuff:
                    .
                    .
                    .
                BASE oldaddr+$-stuff

IF / ELSEIF / ELSE / ENDIF

        Process a block of code if an expression is true (nonzero).

                IF j>0
                    DB i/j
                ELSE
                    DB 0
                ENDIF

IFDEF / IFNDEF

        Process a block of code if a symbol has been defined / not defined.

                IFDEF _DEBUG_
                    .
                    .
                    .
                ENDIF

MACRO / ENDM

        MACRO name args...

        Define a macro.  Macro arguments are comma separated.
        Labels defined inside macros are local (visible only to that macro).

                MACRO setAXY x,y,z
                    LDA #x
                    LDX #y
                    LDY #z
                ENDM

                setAXY $12,$34,$56
                        ;expands to LDA #$12
                        ;           LDX #$34
                        ;           LDY #$56

REPT / ENDR

        Repeat a block of code a specified number of times.
        Labels defined inside REPT are local.

                i=0
                REPT 256
                    DB i
                    i=i+1
                ENDR

ENUM / ENDE

        Reassign PC and suppress assembly output.  Useful for defining
        variables in RAM.

                ENUM $200
                foo:    db 0
                foo2:   db 0
                ENDE

ERROR

        Stop assembly and display a message.

                IF x>100
                        ERROR "X is out of range :("
                ENDIF
